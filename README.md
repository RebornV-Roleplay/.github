At **Ora**, we strive to build an environment where every player can fully immerse themselves in their character and
craft unique stories. Here’s what defines our roleplay experience:

### 🎭 In-Game Roleplay

  stories.

  this influence.
- **Enhanced Map**: Significant map modifications to enrich the gameplay experience.
- **Civil RP Focus**: **Political** and **Justice RP** form the backbone of civil interactions, driving in-depth
  storylines.
